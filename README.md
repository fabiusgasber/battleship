🎮 **Live Demo**: [Play the game here!](https://fabiusgasber.github.io/battleship/)  

## 📌 About the Project  

This project is part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship#project-solution) **Advanced JavaScript Curriculum**.  

### 🛠️ What I Learned  
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** using **Jest** (focusing on game logic, as UI testing is covered later in the curriculum).  
- Applying **SOLID principles** by structuring the code into multiple **classes and factories** for better maintainability.  

### 🏗️ Game Architecture  
The game is structured into the following components:  
- **Gameboard** – Manages ships and attacks.  
- **Player** – Handles player actions and AI behavior.  
- **Ship** – Represents individual ships with hit detection.  
- **DOM Manager** – Controls the user interface.
